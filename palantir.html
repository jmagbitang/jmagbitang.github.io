              Collaborating closely with our early adopters, I focused on designing various low-hanging fruit features for easier adoption of Dossier in their day-to-day workflows.
              This included focusing on automating tasks such as citations.

              As formal report writers, our clients needed a way to easily source all their pieces in PG—and sometimes all the way to the property- and value- level of a single object.
              These reports could include up to <b>more than 1000 citations, which they manually format by copy-pasting</b>.

      <!-- GAIA -->
        <h1>gaia</h1>
        <p class="body">
          Lastly, I worked on Gaia (maps) for my last few weeks at Palantir, where I researched and created early designs for extending our <b>map visualization features</b>.
        </p>
          <h2>map visualizations</h2>
          <p class="body" style="margin-top: -0.4em">
            Working on another large analytical artifact, I improved maps by putting together new map visualizations for our Gaia module.

          <h2>presentation vs. analysis</h2>
          <p class="body" style="margin-top: -0.4em">
            Working with various clients who heavily use our map visualization features, an important lesson I learned were the two main uses of map visualizations — presentation and analysis.
            <ol class="roman">
              <li class="body"><b>Presentation</b> focused on seeing <b>trends at a glance</b> of a map visualization. These visualizations often involved visuals that are hard to read granularly, such as gradients.</li>
              <li class="body"><b>Analysis</b> focused on hunting for <b>specific data points or values</b>. These encompassed visualizations with points, distinct shapes and/or lines.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <svg width="600" height="100" style="padding-left: 12.7em;">
             <rect width="500" height="100" style="fill:#ddd;" />
            <!-- image of presentation vs analysis maps -->
          </svg>
          <p class="caption">
            Contrasting presentation and analytic map visualizations
          </p>

          <h2>visual math</h2>
          <p class="body" style="margin-top: -0.4em">
            I focused on presentation-type map visualizations, dealing with multiple colours and varying intensities.
            The biggest challenge with controlling these visualizations is <b>knowing what the variables are, and how they affect your visualization</b>.
          </p>
          <p class="body">
            To start off, these visualizations often compare densities of something. A frequency. A point's property value.
            When densities are in play, users would want to tend to focus on clusters that show extreme low or high.
            But there is a cost to beauty. These polished gradients and vibrant clusters are controlled by variables that change based on <b>statistical distribution equations</b>—which smooth your gradients and weigh your clusters accordingly.
          </p>
          <svg width="600" height="100" style="padding-left: 12.7em;">
             <rect width="500" height="100" style="fill:#ddd;" />
            <!-- analogies of map and effects to heatmap; intensity, colour stops, radii -->
          </svg>
          <p class="caption">
            You thought teaching math was hard. Try making someone *implicitly* understand the math.
          </p>
          <p class="body">
            Another improvement made was the control of colour.
            Colour stops are an important feature when fine-tuning the semantics of map visualization.
            This also allowed for the user to easily map what values the colours corresponded to without having to provide multiple fall-off points, decluttering the UI.
          </p>

          <p class="body">
            Moreover, I researched on more accessible palettes (read: I will never stop playing with and raving about <a href="https://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~dag/CUBEHELIX/cubetry.html" target="_blank" class="body">Cubehelix</a>)
            to provide out of the box for our users.
            My palettes of choice became Cubehelix for print, Viridis for digital, and ColorBrewery for choropleths (especially for qualitiative and divergent sets).

            Moreover, I was able to experience more facets of the PG product, and Palantir as an organization.

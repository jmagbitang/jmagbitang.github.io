          At BlueDot, we had another existing MVP called GeorgeBOT, which was a Slack chatbot translated from their consumer app on infectious diseasesâ€”George. Instead of showing disease risks per city, GeorgeBOT provided diagnoses of tropical infectious diseases.
          The algorithm existed and was translated into a bot in order for the clinical team to check their database of symptom-disease relationships.</p>

          <p>GeorgeBOT's new iteration comes from the user testing results found from <a href="wyatt.html">Wyatt</a>. My role was to iterate on the new design of Wyatt, integrating GeorgeBOT's capabilties, while focusing to create a lightweight consumer
            "app" on a chat botplatform. </p>
          <p>From bot identity, to Slack and Messenger commands, to every word of the copy, I iterated and designed GeorgeBOT 2.0.</p>

          <p>A chatbot is better at staying relevant than a mobile app. Based on recent news and trends, the rise of chatbots is apparent. For example, the Economist reported that 2.5 billion people have at least one messaging app installed, and in a couple
            of years, this number is expected to skyrocket to 3.6 billion. Text-based services are convenient, reliable, and can be abandoned and picked up with little to no consequence. Most importantly, people won't have to leave their most frequently
            used apps.</p>

            GeorgeBOT was then put back into the surface to be redeveloped. Georgebot started as a verification tool for BlueDot's symptom data, put into a chat bot in Slack that took yes or no inputs.

            Thus, the game plan for GeorgeBOT 2.0 was to first increase awareness, then streamline the to-do's. BlueDot's consumer products have always had the underlying goal of increasing awareness on infectious diseases. Travel-related diseases becoming a public
            health concern, the solution we strive for is a proactive one.</p>

          <p>Aligning with the stakeholder's needs, GeorgeBOT had to be a balance of a relevant and fun consumer product, while standing as a provider of niche medical expertise on infectious diseases. Research with subject matter experts were done to recreate
            the feel of a doctor's visit into a bot, and see if this was an appropriate approach to a health chatbot. Moreover, various chatbots were tested and reviewed, such as Poncho the Weather cat (which I still use to this day).</p>

        <div class="project-body">News was put in with inspiration from the CNN Messenger bot, except this GeorgeBOT would pull from a news API and filter out keywords depending on what the user wants to know about (disease or location-wise). This appears to be the interaction
          with the lowest consequence and hence, would be easy to try and maybe even adopt. Starting with increasing awareness with a low consequence action, I moved on to the more streamlined processes such as travel preparation, finding health services
          nearby, and symptom checking.</div>

            <p>When designing chat bots, copy writing is the design. Although different messaging applications give you different degrees of freedom on how to obtain or provide information to a user through a bot, the meat if the interaction is of course,
              in the text. Text properties such as being too long, timing and delay, chunking, use of emojis, and providing sample repliesâ€”are just some of the may nuances I encountered when writing the logic for GeorgeBOT.</p>

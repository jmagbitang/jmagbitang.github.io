          <p>As a designer for BlueDot Inc. in the summer of 2016, I designed for their upcoming
            <span style="font-family: hk_groteskbold">suite of consumer applications</span> focused on international travel, infectious diseases, and diagnostic tools. Currently, BlueDot has their first consumer app, George, which provides the user information on environmental and health risks,
            based on their location or chosen locations, aggragated by city.

          <p>Wyatt is George's successor, which includes more personalizations, travel preparation, and a medical diagnostic feature.</p>

          <p>Easier air travel means easier spread of diseases. The North American traveller market needs a mobile and accessible solution for assisting them with their awareness, preparation, and treatment with regards to travel-related diseases. They need
            a tool that takes them an extra step further than preparation—which should ultimately get them to treatment in case of acquiring an infectious disease, especially while travelling.</p>

          <p>To begin with, factors such as climate, migration of animals and insect vectors are already changing and creating suitable environments for diseases to thrive in—alarmingly, even in environments they were not suitable in before. But most importantly,
            the unprecedented rate of international travel (surpassing 3.5 billion in 2015) parallels the rapid spread and increase of disease-acquisition risk of both old and novel diseases worldwide.</p>

            Google Ventures' Jake Knapp, Zeratsky, and Kowitz wrote a book in early 2016 about their design sprint process which claims to let you solve and test ideas in five days. This was the perfect process to incorporate in the new design of a consumer mobile
            app, given the timeline.
          </p>
          <p>Long-term goals, sprint questions, and targets were established on the first day. After conducting a concept map and How Might We exercise with BlueDot's founder, I ended up with this final concept map. In this map arose the obvious targets
            to work with—the traveller and their research of travel preparations and medical-related conditions.

          <p>As a rule of thumb (or of Nielsen), 5 users are would optimally find 85% of all usability issues. Within BlueDot, 7 people were recruited through an interview screener. These participants were asked to answer 15 minutes worth of contextual and
            behavioural questions to validate or invaliate the persona hypotheses, and to gain insights from potential users' behaviours and attitudes towards health and travel.
